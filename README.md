# Literally What ðŸ¤¨

## What is this?

This is an example of how Babel's ecosystem using loose versioning and Yarn's Lockfile can bite you in the tooshy!

## How it works

- We require `@babel/eslint-parser @ 7.19.1`
- `@babel/eslint-parser @ 7.19.1` requires `@babel/core @ >= 7.11.0`
- `@babel/core @ 7.11.0` requires `@babel/parser @ ^7.11.0`
- `@babel/eslint-parser @ 7.17.0` introduced a requirement of an identifier (`doubleAt`) only available at `@babel/parser @ 7.17.0` 
- Note, that apart from my resolutions being a bit pushy (due to an _inadequacy_ (this isn't the __perfect__ word, but it's not ideal!) in `@babel/eslint-parser`'s package) this is fully valid and possible for a properly managed project to get into this state

## How to make it ðŸ’¥ and then âœ…

In the initial state run:

- `yarn install`
- `yarn eslint --config ./.eslintrc.js main.js`
- See the boom ðŸ’¥

Next "try" to fix the project by:

- Removing the `resolutions` field from the _package.json_
- Removing the _node_modules_ folder `rm -rf node_modules` -- Ol' reliable
- Running another `yarn install`
- yarn eslint --config ./.eslintrc.js main.js
- Again, see the boom ðŸ’¥

Next actually fix the project by:

- Bumping @babel/core by a single patch version `7.11.1`
- Running `yarn install`
- Running `yarn eslint --config ./.eslintrc.js main.js`
- See that lovely âœ…

## Why does this work! Explain yourself ðŸ‘Š

Due to the resolutions being gone and yarn needing to re-fetch dependencies and thus reassess transitive dependencies we allow the `^` to do its unholy work and fetch for us `@babel/parser @ >= 7.17.0` which means that we are no longer comparing the template string's `undefined` `label` property (the monkey patched version doesn't have this property and it should since the objects should be similar enough to avoid this uncertainty __imnsho__) to `@babel/parser @ < 7.17.0`'s `undefined` `doubleAt` type which means we do the following comparison `label === tl.doubleAt` where `label` is `undefined` and `tl.doubleAt` is `undefined` thus dropping us into the handler for an unexpected scenario wherein the default value returned is `Punctuator` for a scenario that should return `Template`.

## Solution 

Babel's choice / mistake of not updating the `peerDependency` on `@babel/core @ >= 7.11.0` to be `@babel/core @ >= 7.17.0` in `@babel/eslint-parser @ >= 7.17.0` means that we have no way of knowing why ESLint is failing since by Semver's standard we are totally valid and our yarn.lock is not going to update it's resolutions to use more modern version unless we have a valid reason / warning to do so. A warning from `@babel/eslint-parser @ >= 7.17.0` that informed us that a `peerDependency` on `@babel/core @ >= 7.17.0` would be sufficient warning to remove this issue.
